# Mod Update-JSONs
Here I save and publish all the Update JSON Files for my mods so that forge can load and read them on the client.

Issues are turned off because reasons. (For real. who will write a issue here?)

### How can I see updates?
If new updates (for any mods that use the Forge Update System) is available for your MC version the "Mods"-button in the Main Menu will hava a green blinking orb.
When the Button has this Orb and you open the menu you can also see this things on in the mod list and if you click on the mod you should get a changelog and a link to the download page
